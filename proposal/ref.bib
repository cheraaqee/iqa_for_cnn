		abstract = { This paper describes a novel method for edge feature detection of document images based on wavelet decomposition and reconstruction. By applying the wavelet decomposition technique, a document image becomes a wavelet representation, i.e. the image is decomposed into a set of wavelet approximation coefficients and wavelet detail coefficients. Discarding wavelet approximation, the edge extraction is implemented by means of the wavelet reconstruction technique. In consideration of the mutual frequency, overlapping will occur between wavelet approximation and wavelet details, a multiresolution-edge extraction with respect to an iterative reconstruction procedure is developed to ameliorate the quality of the reconstructed edges in this case. A novel combination of this multiresolution-edge results in clear final edges of the document images. This multi-resolution reconstruction procedure follows a coarser-to-finer searching strategy. The edge feature extraction is accompanied by an energy distribution estimation from which the levels of wavelet decomposition are adaptively controlled. Compared with the scheme of wavelet transform, our method does not incur any redundant operation. Therefore, the computational time and the memory requirement are less than those in wavelet transform. }

Here, we propose a two-stage edge extraction approach with contextual-filter edge detector and multiscale edge tracker to solve the problems. The edge detector detects most edges and the tracker refines the results as well as reduces the noised or blurred influence; moreover, the extracted results are nearly thinned edges which are suitable for most applications. Based on six wavelet basis functions, qualitative and quantitative comparisons with other methods show that the proposed approach extracts better edges than the other wavelet-based edge detectors and Canny detector extract."

First, we use directional derivative filters (DDFs) to extract the edge direction feature which is one of the main characteristics of SCIs. To obtain the perceptual quality measures, we separately extract the edge direction and gradient magnitude for the similarity computation between the reference and distorted SCIs. Finally, considering the computational complexity, we incorporate the DDF-based feature map with the gradient magnitude map together to generate a new visual quality metric. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method is able to adapt better to the human visual system than 12 representative methods based on the screen image quality assessment database (SIQAD) 1 .},

	abstract = {Screen content images (SCI) are composed of texts, graphics, images, emails, web pages, and other computergenerated components which make it different from the pure natural images. As a result, image quality assessment (IQA) methods designed for natural images are not always suitable for screen content images. However, as time goes, many screen contents are being generated which share several properties of natural images. As a result, IQA methods for SCI need to be more generic while giving priority to the prominent SCI features. The image gradient is a very important feature for all kinds of images, especially for SCI. In this paper, we proposed a novel image gradient based similarity index (CGSI) for screen content images where the gradient is used both as a quality map and extractor for another feature map. Our previous studies show that the center part of an image is visually the most important part and HVS is more sensitive to any distortion in the middle area. To address this issue, the center area of both gradient and feature similarity maps are raised by element-wise squaring. Eventually, the final quality score is calculated using a summation of standard deviation based pooling strategy. We evaluated our proposed method on three large scale SCI databases and compared with 8 other state-of-the-art IQA methods designed for both natural and screen content images. Results show that the proposed approach provides competitive performance and defeats all other methods with a large gap in overall performance. Also, the relatively faster running time makes it suitable for most of the real-time applications.},

	abstract = {Objective visual quality assessment specific for screen content images (SCIs) has been increasingly investigated over the years. In this paper, an effective full-reference quality evaluation model for SCIs is proposed, in which edge features in gradient domain (EFGD) are extracted for better visual perceptual representation. Unlike traditional edge feature extraction directly in the image pixel domain, all edge features in the proposed EFGD model are extracted based on the gradient map of input SCIs, including edge sharpness, edge brightness/contrast, and edge chrominance. Specifically, the gradient profile model that can well represent the spatial layout of edges is adopted to measure the edge sharpness degree. A novel computation way is reported to measure the edge brightness and contrast change between the reference and distorted SCIs, while color moments are used to account for the color chrominance variation. In addition, an adaptive weighting strategy is designed to adjust the effects of these three kinds of edge features, according to the statistical distributions of the input SCIs. Moreover, the maximum value of edge sharpness features is extracted from the test SCIs as the pooling weight to get the final image quality assessment (IQA) score. The experimental results on two commonly used SCIs databases have verified the superiorities of the EFGD model and show that the EFGD model is in more conformity with the subjective assessment results than most of the existing IQA models.},

	abstract = {In this letter, we make the first attempt to explore the usage of the gradient direction to conduct the perceptual quality assessment of the screen content images (SCIs). Specifically, the proposed approach first extracts the gradient direction based on the local information of the image gradient magnitude, which not only preserves gradient direction consistency in local regions, but also demonstrates sensitivities to the distortions introduced to the SCI. A deviation-based pooling strategy is subsequently utilized to generate the corresponding image quality index. Moreover, we investigate and demonstrate the complementary behaviors of the gradient direction and magnitude for SCI quality assessment. By jointly considering them together, our proposed SCI quality metric outperforms the state-of-the-art quality metrics in terms of correlation with human visual system perception.},

The turnkey novelty lies in the use of an existing para-metric edge model to extract two types of salient attributesâ€” namely, edge contrast and edge width, for the distorted SCI under assessment and its original SCI, respectively. The ex-tracted information is subject to conduct similarity measure-ments on each attribute, independently. The obtained similar-ity scores are then combined using our proposed edge-width pooling strategy to generate the final IQA score. Hopefully, this score is consistent with the judgment made by the HVS. Experimental results have shown that the proposed IQA met-ric produces higher consistency with that of the HVS on the evaluation of the image quality of the distorted SCI than that of other state-of-the-art IQA metrics.},

	abstract = {Screen content image (SCI) has recently emerged as an active topic due to the rapidly increasing demand in many graphically rich services such as wireless displays and virtual desktops. Image quality models play an important role in measuring and optimizing user experience of SCI compression and transmission systems, but are currently lacking. SCIs are often composed of pictorial regions and computer generated textual/graphical content, which exhibit different statistical properties that often lead to different viewer behaviors. Inspired by this, we propose an objective quality assessment approach for SCIs that incorporates both visual field adaptation and information content weighting into structural similarity based local quality assessment. Furthermore, we develop a perceptual screen content coding scheme based on the newly proposed quality assessment measure, targeting at further improving the SCI compression performance. Experimental results show that the proposed quality assessment method not only better predicts the perceptual quality of SCIs, but also demonstrates great potentials in the design of perceptually optimal SCI compression schemes.},

	abstract = {Research on screen content images (SCIs) becomes important as they are increasingly used in multi-device communication applications. In this paper, we present a study on perceptual quality assessment of distorted SCIs subjectively and objectively. We construct a large-scale screen image quality assessment database (SIQAD) consisting of 20 source and 980 distorted SCIs. In order to get the subjective quality scores and investigate, which part (text or picture) contributes more to the overall visual quality, the single stimulus methodology with 11 point numerical scale is employed to obtain three kinds of subjective scores corresponding to the entire, textual, and pictorial regions, respectively. According to the analysis of subjective data, we propose a weighting strategy to account for the correlation among these three kinds of subjective scores. Furthermore, we design an objective metric to measure the visual quality of distorted SCIs by considering the visual difference of textual and pictorial regions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SCI perceptual quality assessment scheme, consisting of the objective metric and the weighting strategy, can achieve better performance than 11 state-of-the-art IQA methods. To the best of our knowledge, the SIQAD is the first large-scale database published for quality evaluation of SCIs, and this research is the first attempt to explore the perceptual quality assessment of distorted SCIs},

	abstract = {The recent popularity of remote desktop software and live streaming of composited video has given rise to a growing number of applications that make use of the so-called screen content images that contain a mixture of text, graphics, and photographic imagery. Automatic quality assessment (QA) of screen-content images is necessary to enable tasks, such as quality monitoring, parameter adaptation, and other optimizations. Although QA of natural images has been heavily researched over the last several decades, the QA of screen content images is a relatively new topic. In this paper, we present a QA algorithm called convolutional neural network-based screen content image quality estimator (CNN-SQE), which operates via a fuzzy classification of screen content images into plain-text, computer-graphics/cartoons, and natural-image regions. The first two classes are considered to contain synthetic content (text/graphics), and the latter two classes are considered to contain naturalistic content (graphics/photographs), where the overlap of the classes allows the computer graphics/cartoons segments to be analyzed by both text-based and natural-image-based features. We present a CNN-based approach for the classification, an edge-structure-based quality degradation model, and a region-size-adaptive quality-fusion strategy. As we will demonstrate, the proposed CNN-SQE algorithm can achieve better/competitive performance as compared with the other state-of-the-art QA algorithms.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an accurate and efficient full-reference image quality assessment (IQA) model using the extracted Gabor features, called Gabor feature-based model (GFM), is proposed for conducting objective evaluation of screen content images (SCIs). It is well-known that the Gabor filters are highly consistent with the response of the human visual system (HVS), and the HVS is highly sensitive to the edge information. Based on these facts, the imaginary part of the Gabor filter that has odd symmetry and yields edge detection is exploited to the luminance of the reference and distorted SCI for extracting their Gabor features, respectively. The local similarities of the extracted Gabor features and two chrominance components, recorded in the LMN color space, are then measured independently. Finally, the Gabor-feature pooling strategy is employed to combine these measurements and generate the final evaluation score. Experimental simulation results obtained from two large SCI databases have shown that the proposed GFM model not only yields a higher consistency with the human perception on the assessment of SCIs but also requires a lower computational complexity, compared with that of classical and state-of-the-art IQA models.11The source code for the proposed GFM will be available at http://smartviplab.org/pubilcations/GFM.html.},

	abstract = {A great deal of evidence suggests that early in processing, retinal images are filtered by parallel, spatial frequency selective channels. We attempt to incorporate this view of early vision with the principle of global precedence, which holds that Gestalt-like processes sensitive to global image configurations tend to dominate local feature processing in human pattern perception. Global precedence is inferred from the pattern of reaction times observed when visual patterns contain multiple cues at different levels of spatial scale. Specifically, it is frequently observed that global processing times are largely unaffected by conflicting local cues, but local processing times are substantially lengthened by conflicting global cues. The asymmetry of these effects suggests the dominant role of global configurations. Since global spatial information is effectively represented by low spatial frequencies, global precedence potentially implies a low frequency dominance. The thesis is that low spatial frequencies tend to be available before information carried by higher frequency bands, producing a coarse-to-fine temporal order in visual spatial perception. It is suggested that a variety of factors contribute to the ''prior entry'' of low frequency information, including the high contrast gain of the magnocellular pathway the amplitude spectra typical of natural images, and inhibitory interactions between the parallel frequency-tuned channels. Evidence suggesting a close relationship between global precedence and spatial frequency channels is provided by observations that the essential features of the global precedence effect are obtained using patterns consisting of low and high frequency sinusoids. The hypothesis that these asymmetric interference effects are due to interactions between parallel spatial channels is supported by an analysis of reaction times (RTs), which shows that RTs to redundant low and high frequency cues produce less facilitation than predictions that assume the channels are independent. In view of previous work showing that global precedence depends upon the low frequency content of the stimuli, we suggest that low spatial frequencies represent the sine qua non for the dominance of configurational cues in human pattern perception, and that this configurational dominance reflects the microgenesis of visual pattern perception. This general view of the temporal dynamics of visual pattern recognition is discussed, is considered from an evolutionary perspective, and is related to certain statistical regularities in natural scenes. Potential adaptive advantages of an interactive parallel architecture that confers an initial processing advantage to low resolution information are explored.},

This test examined Full References (FR) and No Reference (NR) objective video quality models that predicted the quality of standard definition television (625-line and 525-line). Models were submitted in 1999 and VQEG's Final Report was approved June, 2000. All NR models were withdrawn. The FRTV Phase I subjective data are included in the final report; and all video sequences are available to researchers. Models that are trained on these datasets must not be compared to the models submitted to VQEG for independent validation in 1999. Such a comparison is misleading, because the experiments contain mainly source scenes and HRCs that were unknown to the model developers},
